I am a Ph.D. student in Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania, working closely with Professors Insup Lee, James Weimer, and Osbert Bastani. My research focuses on developing solutions to real-world challenges in machine learning applications, with a specific interest in confidence calibration and detecting covariate shift. Through my work, I aim to address key issues that impact the practical deployment of machine learning algorithms. Prior to pursuing my Ph.D., I earned a master's degree in the same field at the University of Pennsylvania. Additionally, I hold a bachelor's degree in both Computer Science and Engineering and Business from Seoul National University.
