I build an android audio guide app for Philadelphia Museum of Arts. The audio files are stored as mp3 files, and the information about artworks is parsed from webpages. Once an user selects a specific tour, the audio files and information files are dowanloded from a server. After the download finishes, the user can choose a specific artwork, and he/she can listen the audio guide, and read the description of the artwork.

This app is developed using the native android API.
