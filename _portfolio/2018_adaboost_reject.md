We propose an adaboost with reject option algorithm to reduce false SpO2 alaram. Based on the vanilla adaboost algorithm, we introduce a reject option when the output values for each class are close enough. We applied this algorithm to detect false low SpO2 alarms. This research result is published in CHASE 2018. [Paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/am/pii/S2352648318300370){:target='_blank'}
