We build an android app which manage watching history of dramas and animes. It imports the dramas/animes informations using [TheTVDB](https://thetvdb.com/) API. This app provides the list of seasons/episodes and an user can check whether he/she has watched the epsiode or not. It alos shows a randomly selected season banner as a background image.
Currently, this apps is not being published because this app does not support the recent TheTVDB api.
